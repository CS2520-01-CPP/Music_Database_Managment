# Music_Database_Managment
We will develop a tkinter application that simplifies MySQL database management to store songs into playlists and allow easy manipulations using basic CRUD options. The system will ensure ease of use through a clean UI while incorporating basic security features like user authentication.

# how to run
Pull code from this git repo
and install the requirements.txt

By default, the database has a user: admin 
                               pass: admin
